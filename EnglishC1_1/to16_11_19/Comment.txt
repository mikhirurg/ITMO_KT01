This question could be a dilemma for many employers.
Let's try to understand which choice will be better for the company.
Frequently, candidates, who are good on paper and perfect in all qualities could not be able
to invent something new. They can be very qualified and can ideally do the job,
but often they are not creative. I think, that I will trust my gut feeling, because candidate
who is not perfect on paper and nervous in the interview could be a genius in some aspects of work.
He could be that person who can offer an unusual solution. I know a lot of good mathematicians who are
quite asocial and do not name themselves great specialists, but they can solve very difficult problems.
