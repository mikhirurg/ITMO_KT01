In my opinion, I would trust my gut feeling, but I will do it carefully.
Because if I will do design relying only on my preferences, my boss
could be not satisfied with my work. I think I'll add some good small solutions on the website, not extremely changing the
"sterile and boring" design. In this case, the boss will see that I listen to his ideas, and I am able
to modify it creatively and made it good-looking for customers.
