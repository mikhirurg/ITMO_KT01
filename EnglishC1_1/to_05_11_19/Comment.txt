The first thing that needs to be said is that this article
perfectly describes the Saint-Petersburg in the winter.
The author of this article didn't forget to mention the great architecture of Northern Capital,
the history of the city, and some Russian traditions. At the end of the article, you can
notice the list of cafes and restaurants which the author can recommend to tourists.
In sum, these aspects made this article useful for planning a trip to the northern part of Russia.

I was interested in a couple of points in this article.
There was a paragraph about Faberge eggs. These fabulous treasures were made for the richest and powerful persons in the world
as tsars or extremely successful businessmen. For me, as a fan of mysteries, this theme is very attractive. Because nowadays a couple of Faberge eggs are lost and nobody knows where they are. Many museums in the world promise a great reward to a person who'll find them.

Also, there was another interesting moment in this article
The author noted that some Russians have nostalgic feelings about the Soviet past. And this fact could surprise because not all of them were born at that time. In my opinion, this happens because nowadays there is a financial crisis in Russia. It is a normal part of capitalism economics, but not everybody understands it. It is true that in socialistic countries people have equal rights to get food, clothing, work, healthcare, and education. That was a great idea. But, unfortunately in our society socialism cannot compete with capitalism.

To conclude, one can say that this article is not the only brochure for tourists. It contains many interesting facts about Russian history and thoughts about ideas in Russian society.
