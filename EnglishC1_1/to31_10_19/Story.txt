One year ago I took part in an exciting journey to the Alps.
That summer I was in math camp in Germany and one of the last days
We rode to Mittenwald - a small town near the border of Switzerland.
No sooner had our train comes to the station I saw these huge majestic rocks
I was very impressed when I come to Germany, I enjoyed the European lifestyle,
beautiful authentic architecture, but this landscape was the best thing that I saw on this trip.
Never have I had such feelings when I was near nature.
Also, this small town was really interesting and cute.
These small houses, open bakeries, bars seem very national.
And one thing: German punctuality was even in the wild. There was no rubbish on the ground,
or behind the rock, or anywhere else.
At no time I saw such an orderly wild nature than I saw in that place.
In the end, I can say that never before I was so impressed because of nature
