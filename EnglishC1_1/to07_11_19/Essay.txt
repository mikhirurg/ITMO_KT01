I stayed in the Belmond Grand Hotel Europe - a good hotel for European residents in St. Petersburg.
It was very rich and comfortable, but the hotel's staff did not pay much attention to my remarks.
To my surprise it costs 340 euro per night, that is quite costly even for German hotels.

Most of the first day I spent in the Hermitage - one of the most major art and sculpting museum in the world.
The exhibitions in the museum impressed me a lot. I saw lots of paintings by great European artists like Leonardo da Vinci or Giorgione.
Also, I was interested in the collection of ancient Egyptian artifacts.
All these parts of the museum were perfect, but it was quite overrun with tourists. Luckily there was a lot of space for many groups of tourists
so we did not feel discomfort.

I wrapped up the day by tasting Russian national cuisine in "Hamlet & Jacks" about what I heard in the article in Financial Times.
It was quite expensive, but I enjoyed it. It is fantastic when you can taste good-cooked food and see the whole center of one of the most beautiful cities in Europe.

Through the window, you can see the neat embankment of the Moika river and great walls of Great Staff building.
From that restaurant, you can easily get to the Palace Square - the place with great photo ops. There you can see many great sights of St. Petersburg.

Then I get to the hotel and relax in the jacuzzi. I think this opportunity can justify any price of a room.
