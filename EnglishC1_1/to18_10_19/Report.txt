1. This report is made up to show the plan of the cultural program for students from Nanning University on their trip to St. Petersburg.
After analyzing the reviews of the previous year's program it was decided to change the program's theme.
The previous year's program was based on sports activities. But because students come to Russia in autumn, it is better to organize cultural events that can introduce guests to Russian culture.

After breakfast, there will be a cultural quest around the city center. This activity will show students the great architecture of St. Petersburg. After the quest guests will be able to buy some
attributes of Russian culture in the souvenir shop at Nevskiy Prospect.
After going to the hotel, students will supper in Caf√© and try Russian donuts(Pyishki).
4. On the second day, guests will be divided into two groups. One group will go to Hermitage and the second group will go to the museum of modern art "Erarta".
After excursions in museums students will go to the amusement park "Divo Ostrov", there they will be able to be introduced in Russian mass culture.
At the end of the program, students will spend the evening in the park "Letnii sad" or "Marsovo pole" there they can share their impressions of the cultural program, relax and take photos in the center of Northern Capital.
